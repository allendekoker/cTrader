Long Position at 02:00 AM with Risk Management.

This is a trading strategy designed to open a long position at 2:00 AM UTC+0 and close it at 3:45 AM UTC+0. The strategy uses risk management techniques to determine the lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels based on the available equity and desired risk percentage.

How it works:
The strategy first defines the entry and exit times using the timestamp() function. It then sets the initial investment amount as a percentage of the equity available, and calculates the position size based on the lot size and desired risk percentage.

When the entry time is reached, the strategy opens a long position with the calculated position size, and sets the stop loss and take profit levels. It then checks for any stop loss or take profit levels that have been hit, and closes the position if necessary.

How to use it:
To use this strategy, you need to copy and paste the code into a new cBot script in the cTrader platform. You can then configure the lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels to suit your preferences and risk tolerance.

It is recommended to backtest the strategy on historical data and adjust the parameters accordingly before using it in a live trading environment.
